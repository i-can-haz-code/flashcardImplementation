# flashcardImplementation
Flash cards are used by people to remember things , this project aims to be a simple but precise implementation of the use of flash cards. the code is divided mainly into 2 parts , the first part being the actual testing the user part and the second part of the code involves returning a result to the user regarding their performance. the questions that seem to take long are added to a priority list and from there ,  a new list of seperate questions that require the user's attention is made.
